# Django Backend Blog Application.

## Overview

This project is a **Django Blog Application** built using the **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. It provides a robust backend API that allows users to interact with blog posts effectively.

### Key Components

- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs in Django, enabling easy creation and management of RESTful services.
  
- **Django Rest Knox**: Utilized for token-based authentication, providing a secure way for users to log in and manage their sessions without exposing sensitive information.

- **Light Database**: The application is designed to work efficiently with a lightweight database, ensuring quick access and minimal overhead.

- **Serializer**: Custom serializers are implemented to convert complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, into JSON format, making it easy to send and receive data through the API.

This blog application allows users to create, read, update, and delete posts while managing user authentication seamlessly.
